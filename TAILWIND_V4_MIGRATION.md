# Tailwind CSS v4.1 Migration Guide

This document outlines the changes made to upgrade from Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 to v4.1.4.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates
- Updated `tailwindcss` from `^3.4.17` to `^4.1.4`
- Moved `tailwindcss` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` (as required by v4)
- Removed `autoprefixer` and `tailwindcss-animate` (no longer needed with v4)

### 2. CSS Changes (app/globals.css)
- Replaced `@tailwind` directives with `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Moved custom animations from tailwind.config.ts to CSS file
- Preserved all custom CSS variables and design tokens

### 3. Configuration Changes (tailwind.config.ts)
- Simplified configuration by removing keyframes and animations (now handled in CSS)
- Removed plugins array (tailwindcss-animate no longer needed)
- Kept all color tokens and theme extensions

### 4. PostCSS Configuration (postcss.config.mjs)
- Updated plugin from `tailwindcss: {}` to `"@tailwindcss/postcss": {}`

## Breaking Changes Addressed

1. **Import Method**: Changed from `@tailwind` directives to `@import` statement
2. **Animation Definitions**: Moved from config to CSS using standard `@keyframes`
3. **Plugin System**: Removed dependency on external plugins like `tailwindcss-animate`
4. **PostCSS Integration**: Updated to use the new PostCSS plugin

## Benefits of v4.1

- **Better Performance**: Improved build times and smaller bundle sizes
- **Native CSS Features**: Better integration with modern CSS features
- **Simplified Configuration**: Less complex setup and configuration
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better error messages and debugging

## Compatibility

All existing classes and utilities remain functional. The upgrade maintains backward compatibility for:
- All existing color tokens
- Custom CSS variables
- Responsive breakpoints
- Dark mode functionality
- All Radix UI components and their styling

## Post-Migration Steps

After merging this PR:

1. Run `npm install` to install the new Tailwind version
2. Test all components to ensure styling is preserved
3. Check that animations still work correctly
4. Verify dark mode functionality
5. Test responsive breakpoints

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Clear your build cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check that all import statements are correct
4. Verify that the PostCSS configuration is properly loaded
