# Tailwind CSS 4.1.12 Migration Complete 🎉

## Files Removed ❌
The following files have been removed as they are no longer needed in Tailwind v4:

### `tailwind.config.ts` 
- **Reason**: Migrated to CSS-first approach using `@theme` in globals.css
- **Migration**: All configuration moved to `app/globals.css` using `@theme` directive

### `postcss.config.mjs`
- **Reason**: PostCSS processing now built into Tailwind v4
- **Migration**: No replacement needed - functionality integrated

### Dependencies Removed from `package.json`:
- `autoprefixer` - Built into Tailwind v4
- `postcss` - No longer needed  
- `tailwindcss-animate` - Animations now built-in
