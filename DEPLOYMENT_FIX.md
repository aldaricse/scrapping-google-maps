# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
Vercel deployment failed with:
```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json
```

## Root Cause
The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file contained old Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 dependencies, but `package.json` was updated to Tailwind CSS 4.1.12.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ **Added `.vercelignore`** - Temporarily ignore the old lock file during deployment
2. ✅ **Vercel will auto-generate** a new `pnpm-lock.yaml` with correct dependencies
3. ✅ **Future deployments** will use the new lock file

## Expected Behavior
- Vercel will now install dependencies fresh on first deployment
- A new `pnpm-lock.yaml` will be generated with Tailwind CSS 4.1.12
- Subsequent deployments will be faster using the cached lock file

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)
If Vercel still fails, these are backup options:

### Option 1: Manual Lock File Deletion
```bash
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install  # This will generate a new lock file
```

### Option 2: Force Vercel to Ignore Frozen Lockfile
Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build"
}
```

### Option 3: Use npm instead (temporary)
Change Vercel settings to use `npm` temporarily:
- Package Manager: `npm`
- Install Command: `npm install`
- Build Command: `npm run build`

**Status**: ✅ Applied fix via `.vercelignore` - Deployment should now succeed
